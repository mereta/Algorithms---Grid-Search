The project consists of four PY files and one text file for creating the world:

robotApp.py - application file
tests.py - testing file
linked_list.py - Linked list file 
linkedList.py - Linked list file 
World1.txt - World Structure

To run the project, please run the test.py file. This will make function calls into the robotApp.py file which is the main driver of the application.

Running the tests should output everything required, including printing the grids for visibility of changes.
